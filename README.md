# WAVY_Longboard
Documentation and code for an electric longboard using Arduino pro minis

eBboard.ino is the arduino c code for the on board unit of the WAVY longboard, and eBremote.ino is the code for the remote 
arduino. Since the code uses direct manipulation of registers in multiple spots, it should be noted that this code will only
work with Arduino Pro Mini's and will need to be modified slightly if wanting to use on another microcontroler.

The WAVY_doc is the final summary for the project submission necessary for class. Covers the basics of what is used on the
board. A documentation file is in the works and will be out soon
